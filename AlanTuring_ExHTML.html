		<h2>Major Acheivments and Contributions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>During World War II, Turing played a pivotal role in breaking the German Enigma code, which was used for encrypting secret messages</li>
			<li> In 1936, Turing introduced the concept of a universal computing machine, now known as a Turing machine, which formed the basis of modern computer architecture</li>
			<li>The Turing Test: Proposed in 1950, the test examines a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. It serves as a benchmark for assessing artificial intelligence and remains influential in the field today. </li>
		</ol>

	<h3> Legacy </h3>

		<p2> Turing's life was marked by persecution and discrimination. In 1952, he was convicted of <em>gross indecency</em> due to his homosexual activities, which were criminalized in the United Kingdom at the time. Turing underwent chemical castration as an alternative to imprisonment. He died two years later, with his death ruled as suicide, though there is ongoing debate about the circumstances.

			In recent years, Turing's contributions and the injustice he faced have been widely recognized. He is celebrated as one of the pioneers of computer science and is considered a symbol of the struggle for LGBTQ+ rights.
